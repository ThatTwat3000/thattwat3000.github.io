## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **ThatTwat3000**, your friendly neighborhood Japanese web novel translator and aspiring author. Welcome to my corner of the internet! ðŸŒŸ

### ðŸŒ¸ What I Do

- **Web Novel Translations:** I specialize in translating Japanese web novels into English. I pour my heart into capturing the essence and nuances of each story, trying to get you the most authentic reading experience possible. I have worked on 9 novels, of which 2 have been completely translated. I have translated more than 200,000 words, gotten more than 95,000 translation page views, and gained 354 registered translation readers. 

- **Original Novel:** Besides translating, I also craft my own original stories. Currently, I have only written one novel, and it is still publishing. It currently has 114 readers, 7,700 words, and over 2,000 page views.

### âœ¨ Where to Find My Work

All of my translations and original novels are hosted on my profiel at **[Scribble Hub](https://www.scribblehub.com/)**. My translations are also linked on **[Novel Updates](https://novelupdates.com)**.

### ðŸ“š My Goals

- To bring more fantastic Japanese web novels to English-speaking audiences.
- To continue improving my craft and bring you even better stories, both translated and original.
- To build a community of readers who share a love for Asian and Asian-inspired novels.
