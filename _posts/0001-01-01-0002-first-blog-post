This is my first actual blog post on this blog which I so graciously named "TwatBlog3000" after my own username, "ThatTwat3000." 

I am proud to say I have kept this naming scheme consistent for *all* my works. For example, my Discord bot is called "TwatBot3000" and the corresponding Discord webhook is also called by that name. 

There really isn't much I have to say for now so...

# Conclusion

You're gay for reading until the end... joking, I'm joking! I love my gays, my loveliest homosexuals, but you probably aren't one. Well, I guess this is goodbye. Until the next post!

(P.S. Please leave a comment below. You can log into your Disqus account *or* you can comment as a guest by selecting so in the confusing menu. Hope to hear from you soon!)
